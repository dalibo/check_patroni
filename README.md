# check_patroni

A nagios plugin for patroni.

## Features

- Check presence of leader, replicas, node counts.
- Check each node for replication status.


```
Usage: check_patroni [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Nagios plugin that uses Patroni's REST API to monitor a Patroni cluster.

Options:
  --config FILE         Read option defaults from the specified INI file
                        [default: config.ini]
  -e, --endpoints TEXT  Patroni API endpoint. Can be specified multiple times
                        or as a list of comma separated addresses. The node
                        services checks the status of one node, therefore if
                        several addresses are specified they should point to
                        different interfaces on the same node. The cluster
                        services check the status of the cluster, therefore
                        it's better to give a list of all Patroni node
                        addresses.  [default: http://127.0.0.1:8008]
  --cert_file PATH      File with the client certificate.
  --key_file PATH       File with the client key.
  --ca_file PATH        The CA certificate.
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity -v (info)/-vv (warning)/-vvv
                        (debug)
  --version
  --timeout INTEGER     Timeout in seconds for the API queries (0 to disable)
                        [default: 2]
  --help                Show this message and exit.

## Install

check_patroni is licensed under PostgreSQL license.

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/dalibo/check_patroni.git
```

check_patroni works on python 3.6, we keep it that way because patroni also
supports it and there are still lots of RH 7 variants around. That being said
python 3.6 has been EOL for ages and there is no support for it in the github
CI.

## Support

If you hit a bug or need help, open a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/dalibo/check_patroni/issues/new). Dalibo has no
commitment on response time for public free support. Thanks for you
contribution !

## Config file

All global and service specific parameters can be specified via a config file has follows:

```
[options]
endpoints = https://10.20.199.3:8008, https://10.20.199.4:8008,https://10.20.199.5:8008
cert_file = ./ssl/my-cert.pem
key_file = ./ssl/my-key.pem
ca_file = ./ssl/CA-cert.pem
timeout = 0

[options.node_is_replica]
lag=100
```
## Thresholds

The format for the threshold parameters is `[@][start:][end]`.

* `start:` may be omitted if `start == 0`
* `~:` means that start is negative infinity
* If `end` is omitted, infinity is assumed
* To invert the match condition, prefix the range expression with `@`.

A match is found when: `start <= VALUE <= end`.

For example, the following command will raise:

* a warning if there is less than 1 nodes, which can be translated to outside of range [2;+INF[
* a critical if there are no nodes, which can be translated to outside of range [1;+INF[

```
check_patroni -e https://10.20.199.3:8008 cluster_has_replica --warning 2: --critical 1:
```

## SSL

Several options are available:

* the server's CA certificate is not available or trusted by the client system:
  * `--ca_cert`: your certification chain `cat CA-certificate server-certificate > cabundle`
* you have a client certificate for authenticating with Patroni's REST API:
  * `--cert_file`: your certificate or the concatenation of your certificate and private key
  * `--key_file`: your private key (optional)

## Shell completion

We use the [click] library which supports shell completion natively.

Shell completion can be added by typing the following command or adding it to
a file sp√©cific to your shell of choice.

* for Bash (add to `~/.bashrc`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=bash_source check_patroni)"
  ```
* for Zsh  (add to `~/.zshrc`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=zsh_source check_patroni)"
  ```
* for Fish (add to `~/.config/fish/completions/check_patroni.fish`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=fish_source check_patroni)"
  ```

## Node services

### node_is_alive

```
Usage: check_patroni node_is_alive [OPTIONS]

  Check if the node is alive ie patroni is running. This is a liveness check
  as defined in Patroni's documentation.

  Check:
  * `OK`: If patroni is running.
  * `CRITICAL`: otherwise.

  Perfdata:
  * `is_running` is 1 if patroni is running, 0 otherwise

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### node_is_pending_restart

```
Usage: check_patroni node_is_pending_restart [OPTIONS]

  Check if the node is in pending restart state.

  This situation can arise if the configuration has been modified but requires
  a restart of PostgreSQL to take effect.

  Check:
  * `OK`: if the node has no pending restart tag.
  * `CRITICAL`: otherwise

  Perfdata: `is_pending_restart` is 1 if the node has pending restart tag, 0
  otherwise.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### node_is_leader

```
Usage: check_patroni node_is_leader [OPTIONS]

  Check if the node is a leader node.

  This check applies to any kind of leaders including standby leaders. To
  check explicitly for a standby leader use the `--is-standby-leader` option.

  Check:
  * `OK`: if the node is a leader.
  * `CRITICAL:` otherwise

  Perfdata: `is_leader` is 1 if the node is a leader node, 0 otherwise.

Options:
  --is-standby-leader  Check for a standby leader
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

### node_is_primary

```
Usage: check_patroni node_is_primary [OPTIONS]

  Check if the node is the primary with the leader lock.

  This service is not valid for a standby leader, because this kind of node is
  not a primary.

  Check:
  * `OK`: if the node is a primary with the leader lock.
  * `CRITICAL:` otherwise

  Perfdata: `is_primary` is 1 if the node is a primary with the leader lock, 0
  otherwise.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### node_is_replica

```
Usage: check_patroni node_is_replica [OPTIONS]

  Check if the node is a running replica with no noloadbalance tag.

  It is possible to check if the node is synchronous or asynchronous. If
  nothing is specified any kind of replica is accepted. When checking for a
  synchronous replica, it's not possible to specify a lag.

  Check:
  * `OK`: if the node is a running replica with noloadbalance tag and the lag is under the maximum threshold.
  * `CRITICAL`:  otherwise

  Perfdata: `is_replica` is 1 if the node is a running replica with
  noloadbalance tag and the lag is under the maximum threshold, 0 otherwise.

Options:
  --max-lag TEXT  maximum allowed lag
  --is-sync       check if the replica is synchronous
  --is-async      check if the replica is asynchronous
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

### node_patroni_version

```
Usage: check_patroni node_patroni_version [OPTIONS]

  Check if the version is equal to the input

  Check:
  * `OK`: The version is the same as the input `--patroni-version`
  * `CRITICAL`: otherwise.

  Perfdata:
  * `is_version_ok` is 1 if version is ok, 0 otherwise

Options:
  --patroni-version TEXT  Patroni version to compare to  [required]
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

### node_tl_has_changed

```
Usage: check_patroni node_tl_has_changed [OPTIONS]

  Check if the timeline has changed.

  Note: either a timeline or a state file must be provided for this service to
  work.

  Check:
  * `OK`: The timeline is the same as last time (`--state_file`) or the inputted timeline (`--timeline`)
  * `CRITICAL`: The tl is not the same.

  Perfdata:
  * `is_timeline_changed` is 1 if the tl has changed, 0 otherwise
  * the timeline

Options:
  --timeline TEXT        A timeline number to compare with.
  -s, --state-file TEXT  A state file to store the last tl number into.
  --save                 Set the current timeline number as the reference for
                         future calls.
