# Change log

## check_patroni 2.1.0 - 2024-10-19

### Fixed

* cluster_has_replica now properly accounts for standby leaders (#72, reported by @MLyssens)

### Misc

* Update the tests and the documentation to reflect that master is replaced by
  primary everywhere it's visible in Patroni. We didn't use the term so there
  is nothing to change in our code.

## check_patroni 2.0.0 - 2024-04-29

### Notice

While fixing `cluster_has_replica`, the definition of a healthy replica was
changed. It's more restrictive now, hence the jump from v1 to v2.

### Changed

* In `cluster_node_count`, a healthy standby, sync replica or standby leaders cannot be "in
  archive recovery" because this service doesn't check for lag and timelines.

### Added

* Add the timeline in the  `cluster_has_replica` perfstats. (#50)
* Add a mention about shell completion support and shell versions in the doc. (#53)
* Add the leader type and whether it's archiving to the `cluster_has_leader` perfstats. (#58)

### Fixed

* Add compatibility with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io)
  version 2.25 and higher.
* Fix what `cluster_has_replica` deems a healthy replica. (#50, reported by @mbanck)
* Fix `cluster_has_replica` to display perfstats for replicas whenever it's possible (healthy or not). (#50)
* Fix `cluster_has_leader` to correctly check for standby leaders. (#58, reported by @mbanck)
* Fix `cluster_node_count` to correctly manage replication states. (#50, reported by @mbanck)

### Misc

* Improve the documentation for `node_is_replica`.
* Improve test coverage by running an HTTP server to fake the Patroni API (#55
  by @dlax).
* Work around old pytest versions in type annotations in the test suite.
* Declare compatibility with click version 7.1 (or higher).
* In tests, work around nagiosplugin 1.3.2 not properly handling stdout
  redirection.

## check_patroni 1.0.0 - 2023-08-28

Check patroni is now tagged as Production/Stable.

### Added

* Add `sync_standby` as a valid replica type for `cluster_has_replica`. (contributed by @mattpoel)
* Add info and options (`--sync-warning` and `--sync-critical`) about sync replica to `cluster_has_replica`.
* Add a new service `cluster_has_scheduled_action` to warn of any scheduled switchover or restart.
* Add options to `node_is_replica` to check specifically for a synchronous (`--is-sync`) or asynchronous node (`--is-async`).
* Add `standby-leader` as a valid leader type for `cluster_has_leader`.
* Add a new service `node_is_leader` to check if a node is a leader (which includes standby leader nodes)

### Fixed

* Fix the `node_is_alive` check. (#31)
* Fix the `cluster_has_replica` and `cluster_node_count` checks to account for
  the new replica state `streaming` introduced in v3.0.4 (#28, reported by @log1-c)

### Misc

* Create CHANGELOG.md
* Add tests for the output of the scripts in addition to the return code
* Documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md

## check_patroni 0.2.0 - 2023-03-20

### Added

* Add a `--save` option when state files are used
* Modify `-e/--endpoints` to allow a comma separated list of endpoints (#21, reported by @lihnjo)
* Use requests instead of urllib3 (with extensive help from @dlax)
* Change the way logging is handled (with extensive help from @dlax)

### Fix

* Reverse the test for `node_is_pending`
* SSL handling

### Misc

* Several doc Fix and Updates
* Use spellcheck and isort
* Remove tests for python 3.6
* Add python tests for python 3.11
