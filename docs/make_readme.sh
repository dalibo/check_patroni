## Install

check_patroni is licensed under PostgreSQL license.

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/dalibo/check_patroni.git
```

check_patroni works on python 3.6, we keep it that way because patroni also
supports it and there are still lots of RH 7 variants around. That being said
python 3.6 has been EOL for ages and there is no support for it in the github
CI.

## Support

If you hit a bug or need help, open a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/dalibo/check_patroni/issues/new). Dalibo has no
commitment on response time for public free support. Thanks for you
contribution !

## Config file

All global and service specific parameters can be specified via a config file has follows:

```
[options]
endpoints = https://10.20.199.3:8008, https://10.20.199.4:8008,https://10.20.199.5:8008
cert_file = ./ssl/my-cert.pem
key_file = ./ssl/my-key.pem
ca_file = ./ssl/CA-cert.pem
timeout = 0

[options.node_is_replica]
lag=100
```
## Thresholds

The format for the threshold parameters is `[@][start:][end]`.

* `start:` may be omitted if `start == 0`
* `~:` means that start is negative infinity
* If `end` is omitted, infinity is assumed
* To invert the match condition, prefix the range expression with `@`.

A match is found when: `start <= VALUE <= end`.

For example, the following command will raise:

* a warning if there is less than 1 nodes, which can be translated to outside of range [2;+INF[
* a critical if there are no nodes, which can be translated to outside of range [1;+INF[

```
check_patroni -e https://10.20.199.3:8008 cluster_has_replica --warning 2: --critical 1:
```

## SSL

Several options are available:

* the server's CA certificate is not available or trusted by the client system:
  * `--ca_cert`: your certification chain `cat CA-certificate server-certificate > cabundle`
* you have a client certificate for authenticating with Patroni's REST API:
  * `--cert_file`: your certificate or the concatenation of your certificate and private key
  * `--key_file`: your private key (optional)

## Shell completion

We use the [click] library which supports shell completion natively.

Shell completion can be added by typing the following command or adding it to
a file sp√©cific to your shell of choice.

* for Bash (add to `~/.bashrc`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=bash_source check_patroni)"
  ```
* for Zsh  (add to `~/.zshrc`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=zsh_source check_patroni)"
  ```
* for Fish (add to `~/.config/fish/completions/check_patroni.fish`):
  ```
  eval "$(_CHECK_PATRONI_COMPLETE=fish_source check_patroni)"
  ```

Please note that shell completion is not supported far all shell versions, for
example only Bash versions older than 4.4 are supported.

## Connection errors and service status

If patroni is not running, we have no way to know if the provided endpoint is
valid, therefore the check returns UNKNOWN.
